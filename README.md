# RingWorld
A program designed to detect if the mouse has moved off the left side of the left most screen and move it to the right side of the right most screen.
This is done to facilitate large curved screen setups, or even 360Â° rings of monitors.  The future plan is to also support vertical rings of monitors rather than just horizontal, and eventually allow for spherical monitor arangments
